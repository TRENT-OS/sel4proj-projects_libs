 * Get clock divider
 *
 * Generally we start with calculating the theoretically closest divider
 * according to the following formula:
 * 		clock_freq = emmc_base_clock / divider;
 *
 * This clock divider can not be immediately used, but has to be modified in
 * order to comply with the SDHC specification. Depending on the SDHC version,
 * the clock divider is calculated differently.
 *
 * SDHC version < 3.00: 8-bit Divided Clock Mode
 * - 80h -> base clock divided by 256
 * - 40h -> base clock divided by 128
 * - 20h -> base clock divided by 64
 * - 10h -> base clock divided by 32
 * - 08h -> base clock divided by 16
 * - 04h -> base clock divided by 8
 * - 02h -> base clock divided by 4
 * - 01h -> base clock divided by 2
 * - 00h -> Base clock (10MHz-63MHz)
 *
 * In a nutshell this means that the actual divider is always a power of 2. But
 * the content that is set in the "SDCLK Frequency Select" field (bits 8-15) in
 * the "Clock Control Register" is always half of it. We need to find a value
 * that is a power of 2 and as close to the theoretically closest divider.
 *
 * SDHC version == 3.00: 10-bit Divided Clock Mode
 * - 3FFh -> 1/2046 Divided Clock
 * - ...  -> ...
 * - N    -> 1/2N Divided Clock (Duty 50%)
 * - ...  -> ...
 * - 002h -> 1/4 Divided Clock
 * - 001h -> 1/2 Divided Clock
 * - 000h -> Base Clock (10MHz-255MHz)
 *
 * In a nutshell this means that the actual divider is always an even number.
 * The value that is set in the "SDCLK Frequency Select" field (bits 8-15) must
 * be half of the actual divider.
 *
 * For more information, see: SDHC specification, ver 3.00, 2.2.14 Clock Control
